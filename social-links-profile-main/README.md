## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me solidify my understanding of responsive design and hover/focus states. Below are some code snippets that Iâ€™m particularly proud of:

#### HTML Example
```html
<a href="https://twitter.com" class="social-link" aria-label="Twitter">
  <svg>...</svg>
</a>
```

#### CSS Example
```css
.social-link:hover,
.social-link:focus {
  color: var(--primary-color);
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on:

- Improving accessibility by using ARIA roles and labels effectively.
- Exploring advanced CSS animations for interactive elements.
- Enhancing performance by optimizing assets and reducing unnecessary code.
